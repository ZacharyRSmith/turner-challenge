# Twitter App

> My solution to a coding challenge from Turner.  See [instructions](./instructions.md) for requirements.

## Installation and usage instructions

- Git clone this repo down, then

- Run `npm install`, which installs dependencies, then

- Run `npm start`, which spins up a node.js server that uses the Twitter API, then

- Point a browser (preferably an updated Chrome) window to "localhost:3000", which inits the app and renders the user interface.
